# TBD: Project Title

TBD: A mellow top-down farming sim

## Description

TBD: I wanted to learn more about animation in Godot and controlling the movement of other characters. I used [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luf2Kr5s3BM) to explore those topics, and then I continued working on the project. Talk about things I added and learned about (interaction!!!)

A detailed description of what this project does and who it's for. Explain the problem it solves and why it's useful.

## Features

- Player can walk around
- Cows randomly move around
- Player can pet cows, and cows will react
- Player can go inside buildings
- COMING SOON: Gameplay (race the clock? Pet as many cows as you can in x amount of time?)

## Possible Future Features
- Interact with chests
- Main menu
- Two modes: zen mode (no timer) and game mode (timer)
- Add chickens that lay eggs on a timer
- Bring eggs back to the house

## Known Bugs
- Cows: Cow movement is sometimes buggy (e.g. walking animation without walking)
- Cows: When cows and player touch, they can sometimes carry each other
- Cows: When cows hit a wall, they keep walking in that direction
- Doors: Player can close door while in the doorframe --> leads to player being abruptly pushed out of the way
